Your idea for a web application for kirana (general) stores is great! It addresses real pain points faced by small shopkeepers, especially with tracking product locations and managing customer dues. Here are some suggestions to make your application even better:

Key Features to Include:
Product Location Management:

Rack/Shelf System: You already mentioned tracking the product's location by shelf or rack number. Make this dynamic so the shopkeeper can easily update the system when moving products around.
Search Functionality: Allow shopkeepers to search for products by name, category, or brand and instantly see where the item is located in the store.
Visual Layout: Consider adding a visual representation of the store layout, where shopkeepers can see the exact shelf/rack in a map-like view.
Inventory Management:

Stock Monitoring: Provide alerts when a product is running low or out of stock.
Restocking List: Automatically create a "to-buy" list for products that need to be restocked, and allow shopkeepers to mark items as restocked when they arrive.
Batch and Expiry Tracking: Especially for perishable goods, the app could track batch numbers and expiry dates, notifying the shopkeeper when items are about to expire.
Customer Management (Kathabook-Like Feature):

Dues Tracking: Track how much each customer owes and provide notifications for overdue payments.
Payment History: Show a clear payment history for each customer, including dates and amounts.
Reminder Feature: Add SMS/WhatsApp reminders to notify customers about pending payments or upcoming due dates.
Loyalty Program: Implement a simple loyalty point system, where customers earn points for purchases, encouraging them to return.
Out-of-Stock Notification:

Request Feature: When a product is out of stock, allow customers to request it. This can help prioritize restocking based on demand.
Pre-Order Option: For products frequently out of stock, allow customers to pre-order items, so the shopkeeper knows exactly how many units to bring.
Supplier Management: Add a feature where shopkeepers can keep track of different suppliers, helping them quickly reorder products.
User Management for Shops:

Separate Login for Each Store: As you mentioned, each store should have a separate login page. You could also allow multiple users (shop assistants, owners) for each store with different access levels.
Shopkeeper Dashboard: Provide a dashboard that shows key metrics like best-selling items, overdue customer payments, stock levels, and more.
Reports and Analytics:

Sales Analytics: Display which products are selling well, seasonal trends, and customer purchasing habits.
Profit and Loss Tracking: Help shopkeepers track their financials easily by integrating sales, expenses, and dues into a profit-loss statement.
Customer Orders and Delivery:

Online Ordering: Allow customers to place orders online for pickup or delivery, especially for larger kirana stores.
Delivery Tracking: If delivery is offered, provide a simple way to manage and track delivery orders.
Additional Features to Consider:
Barcode Scanning: Use a barcode system for faster product lookup and billing.
Mobile App: Create a mobile version of the app to allow the shopkeeper to easily manage everything on-the-go.
Product Recommendations: Suggest alternative products when something is out of stock or recommend frequently bought-together items to boost sales.
Existing Platforms:
There are similar apps like KhataBook, Vyapar, and OkCredit that handle customer dues and shop management, but they donâ€™t focus much on inventory tracking or shelf management. Your unique idea of shelf management and out-of-stock tracking could set your application apart from these existing solutions.

Final Thoughts:
This app can be very useful, especially in local markets where many shops still rely on manual methods. You can even target smaller cities or rural areas where digital adoption is still growing.
